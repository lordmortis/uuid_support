UUID Support
==============

requires uuidtools

Allows you to use UUIDs in migrations and have them stored and queried efficiently.

Instead of using char(36) everywhere, this plugin endeavours to use native types where supported and appropriate types elsewhere for speed

Types Used:
  Mysql - binary(16)
  Postgresql - uid
  SQLite - binary(16)

Due to the way this plugin works, it will override all instances of the above and return UUIDTools::UUID instead of String

TODO
=============
Ensure uuid ID types are generated properly if not set on a create.

Example
=======

create_table :members, :id => false do |t|
	t.uuid_pkey	:id
	t.uuid :group_id
	t.timestamps
end
